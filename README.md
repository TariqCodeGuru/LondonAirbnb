# Project on Analysing an Airbnb Properties' Dataset

## Installations
You need to have a jupyter notebook environment installed on your pc/mac along with version Python version 3.9. The code is not tested on other versions of Python.

Before running the Jupyter Notebook, you have to download the dataset for london from Inside Airbnb from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/. The data has to be unzipped and placed in the csv/detailed/ path.


## Project Motivation
The project is primarily focused on assessing a dataset including data on the London's Airbnb properties. The dataset used is sourced from Inside Airbnb, an “independent, non-commercial, open source data tool”. The project is meant as a submission for an assignment that is part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree.

The project consists of 3 folders and 3 files (including this README file).

#### Folders:
csv: folder where all airbnb datasets from InsideAirbnb should be downloaded
statistical-gis-boundaries-london: package produced by ONS that helps creating map charts which are used in the project

#### Files:
